1. Limitations of data
  - only the cities included in the original DHH-SEMPARL study are considered (-> requires futher analyzing and processing the data to have more reliable and valid results of the RQ/H)

2. Electoral districts
  - plenary session data includes historical electoral districts (-> manually fixed) (2-> create a csv containing all the historical values)
  
3. Parlamentary groups
  - are defined by the MP's last/latest group, which causes some groups to appear before their inauguration as the MP has been member of multiple parlamentary groups in the past.
